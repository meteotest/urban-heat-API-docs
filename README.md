This documentation describes the **Open-Data API** of the [Smart Urban Heat Map Bern Project](https://smart-urban-heat-map.ch).

The Smart Urban Heat Map is an initiative of the [Smart City Verein Bern](https://www.smartcity-bern.ch/) to visualize urban heat in the city and region of Bern. Valuable pioneering work has been done by the Climatology Group at the [Geographical Institute of the University of Bern (GIUB)](https://www.geography.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), which has been operating an urban measurement network since 2018, consisting of around 80 stations. The Smart City Verein Bern, together with the company [Abilium GmbH](https://www.abilium.io/), the [Bern University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bfh.ch/de/forschung/forschungsbereiche/public-sector-transformation/) and the company [Meteotest](https://meteotest.ch/), has extended this measuring network into the Bern region by around 40 measuring stations.

Based on this measurement network, the Smart Urban Heat Map API offers access to detailed city climate data for the region of Bern, Switzerland. Users can retrieve current measurements of temperature, relative humidity, and location metadata, as well as location-bound time series data. The data provides valuable insights for urban planning and environmental studies.

The documentation is complemented by an [interactive OpenAPI specification](Swagger) and a [Jupyter Notebook](python_examples.ipynb) which includes examples of how to request and visualize the data using Python.
The notebook can be run **locally or directly in the browser** using [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/meteotest/urban-heat-API-docs/main?labpath=python_examples.ipynb)
or [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/meteotest/urban-heat-API-docs/blob/main/python_examples.ipynb).

## Changelog

### API Version 2 <!-- omit in toc -->

This is the second version of the Smart Urban Heat Map API published on 18.06.2024.

**Remark**: In the initial version, the GeoJSON end point `/stations` (now called `/latest`) returned the lat/lon coordinates in the wrong order (`[lat, lon]` rather than `[lon, lat]`).

## Stations, Sensors and Temperature Bias
The measuring stations are built by [Abilium GmbH](https://www.abilium.io/) and are based on the [SHT41A](https://www.mouser.ch/datasheet/2/682/Datasheet_SHT4x-3003109.pdf) Sensorion sensors.
The self-sufficient stations are outfitted with a small solar panel and measure temperature and relative humidity every 10 minutes.
The measurement data is sent out via the Helium LoRaWAN network.
To reduce the potential temperature bias when stations are exposed to direct sunlight, all stations are ventilated before measuring.
**However, in some cases, especially during the day, measured temperatures might still be slightly higher than actual temperatures.**

## Endpoints

### latest <!-- omit in toc -->

Retrieves station data including most recent measured value for:

* Temperature is in Celsius (째C).
* Relative Humidity is in percentage (%).

**URL:** https://smart-urban-heat-map.ch/api/v2/latest  
**Response Formats:** `GeoJSON` (default), `CSV`  

### timeseries <!-- omit in toc -->
Retrieves time series based on stationId for:
* Temperature is in Celsius (째C).
* Relative Humidity is in percentage (%).

**URL:** https://smart-urban-heat-map.ch/api/v2/timeseries  
**Response Formats:** `JSON` (default), `CSV`  
**URL Parameter:**
  * **stationId** (required): specifies from which station to return the time series
  * **timeFrom** (optional, default: "-24hours"): specifies start of time series (Examples: "-3days","-24hours","-30minutes", "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z")
  * **timeTo** (optional, default: "now"): specifies end of time series (Examples: "-3days","-24hours","-30minutes", "now", "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z")

### stations <!-- omit in toc -->

Retrieves station data including date of most recent measurement.

**URL:** https://smart-urban-heat-map.ch/api/v2/stations  
**Response Formats:** `GeoJSON` (default), `CSV`  

## Codebook

### latest <!-- omit in toc -->
